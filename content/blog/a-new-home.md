I have learned Vue for quite a long time, but I don't have any noteable project made with it. And one day, I thought about making a personal blog for me, and I immediately knew what I was going to use to build it. And here it is, a blog built with [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/framework) (a framework based on Vue) and [@nuxt/content](https://github.com/nuxt/content).

This site is still pretty much WIP cause this is a POC I spun up, so stay tuned for future updates!
